# get_next_line_2

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

[Subject](./get_next_line.en.pdf)

This function is based on lists.

get_next_line_bufftmp uses another buffer to reduce the number of mallocs.

Remember to free(line) when get_next_line returns 0.
